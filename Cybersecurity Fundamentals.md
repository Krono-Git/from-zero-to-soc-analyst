<summary>üìò What Are Cybersecurity Fundamentals?</summary>
  
## The very first thing i learned when entering the field, Was the evergrowing rate of cybersecurity attacks, I asked myself why this was, And the answer is quite simple.
As we've witnessed with our own eyes, Technology
Is being used more and more each day, Since the internet boom of the 1990's with the implementation of the world wide web, Spawning big winners like, amazon, facebook, cisco, Real life bad guys (Attackers) Know that
There is money, Ideas, And information, Flying all around the internet everyday in mass quantities, For this reason, Black Hat Hackers, Have been stealing information, Launching phishing campaigns, And organizing botnets,
There is evidence to show that attackers have had much success in launching their attacks, This is best demonstrated through the more recent and popular RansomWare attacks.

But before i could get ahead of myself, I had to take a step back, And understand the inner working of the internet, Endpoints, and Operating systems. I realized that i could understand the goals of attackers, And how they work
however i wasn't going to be able to play in role in actually stopping them one day unless i learned the important fundamentals.

 ## Networking Basics.
- If i were to go back i would focus more on networking basics first, Before any introductory to CyberSecurity, I found myself wondering a lot at times, How something i learned in a cybersecurity course was even possible, That's because i
did not understand networking enough, A great introduction to networking is provided by the cisco networking academy called "Networking Basics" It's Completely free and you get a badge to share on your credly account. i Will go more in detail about
the fundamental learnin resources i used in the next section **"Learning Resources I Used"**

## Introductory to cybersecurity
- Here there is a lot to learn, And if i'm being honest it doesn't to hurt to learn a few of the ideas and concepts from this catergory more then a few times, The difference between good and bad cybersecurity hygiene, Is best given in the example of someone
Who checks a couple fields in an email before clicking an embedded link contained within, Because they've read about and know the dangers of something harmless looking like an embedded link, Or checks whats protocol is being used when visiting a new site
By looking to the left of the search bar, Because they've learned the difference between HTTP & HTTPS, Through introductory cybersecurity material you'll learn the best practices to stay safe on the internet, How the bad guys (Attackers) Operate, And how cybersecurity
defenders and applications are keeping you safe everyday, You'll come to appreciate Internet protocols, The firewall, And create some better passwords. Again cisco networking academy offers a great free course **Introduction to Cybersecurity** Which gives you a shareable
badge upon completiton.

## Ethical Hacking
- Believe it or not, Not all hackers are bad guys! Through taking yet another free course with cisco networking academy **"Ethical hacker"** I've learned about the art of penetration testing, Where people skilled in hacking used those skills to help companies and organizations
Test their ability to prevent, Detect, And recover from cyber security attacks. Those big companies that we use everyday are always under threat by attackers, Who are seeking financial gain.
This is also where i began using kali linux, Though i have used it in the past, I had a new appreciation for the OS once i finished the course, And also recieved a badge. I do think it's very important to understand how the red side operates in cybersecurity if your going to be focusing
on the blue team side of things, And vice versa, You'll learn that are many different ways that attackers can perform basically the same attack.

<summary>üß† Learning Resources I Used</summary>
  
## üåê Networking Basics
- Here are some resources that i've found extremely helpful throughout my journey, These are completly free unless otherwise stated.
## PowerCert Animated Videos | https://www.youtube.com/@PowerCertAnimatedVideos/featured
- This channel is amazing, Here you have access to explanations of basic to advanced networking, Devices, Protocols, etc.
I learned a great amount of networking through this channel, Protocols like, DHCP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, DNS, FTP, TCP/UDP, ARP,
And much more all contained within videos no longer than 10 minutes, Visualized to help you better understand, And completely free!
## Cisco - Networking Basics.
- As i've mentioned cisco has a few free courses you can take, These contain a wealth of great information, And are taught in a fun way. The networking basics course, Is a free 22 hour course, With 13 hands on labs, Where you learn at our own pace,
One of the most interesting things you'll find here though is the **Cisco Packet Tracer** Application, Where you can create virtual network topologies, Using simulated cisco routers and switches,
 They'll have you use the application throughout the course, And it's suprisingly fun and hands on, Here you'll also learn about the different types of networks and how they work, How data flows across the internet, From and to devices,
Network cables, IP addresses and how they work with DNS, the difference between IPV4 and IPV6, Wirelss internet, And protocol standards.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Introductory To Cybersecurity.

## NetworkChuck | https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck/videos
- This is an awesome youtube channel focused on information technology, You'll find almost anything cybersecurity related within the channel, The videos take a fun approach to teaching almost everything related to IT, I personally found it to be a great way to study, While away from
my workstation, Chucks way of teaching makes lessons fun, And he also has a way of making ideas stick, I found it easy to retain information found on the channel.
## SomeOrdinaryGamers | https://www.youtube.com/@SomeOrdinaryGamers/videos
- SomeOrdinaryGamers is a youtube channel i've been tuning into over the past few years, Way before deciding to step into cybersecurity, I would say the channel gained most of it's popularity through it's **"DeepWeb Browsing"** series, This is where i first learned about the **TOR** Browser,
And virtual machines, There is a lot different types of content now on the channel, However if something big happens related to IT or Cybersecurity, The channel likely will make a post about it explaining what happened and breaking it down for you, I found it a great way to stay up to date in
Cybersecurity which is important, However the best videos i can recommend are from the **Malware Investigation** Series ran on the channel, Where **Mutahar** (The channel owner) Actively opens and infects virtual machines with malware, Exaplains what happening and why, If your like me and
are fascinated about malware and viruses, It's definetly work checking out!
## Introduction To Cyber Security - By Cisco Networking Academy
- This course was really important for me, And kind of began to shape a new way of thinking about cybersecurity, It's a 6 hour self paced course, With 7 Labs, Here you'll learn more about how you can protect yourself and those around you from cybersecurity attacks, You'll go through 5 modules, That
Contain textual information as well as informational videos, That will teach you about Cybersecurity, Privacy And Data Confidentiality, Network Vulnerabilities, Threat Detection, And Cyber Best Practices, You'll then finish by taking a final exam and earning a shareable badge, The course is short,
Very valuable information for beginners, I highly recommend taking it and it is 100% Free.
## TryHackMe | Paid & Free Options.
- This is where i spent most of my time after learning my network and cybersecurity fundamentals, I first started off by randomly entering learning rooms that piqued my interest, Mostly red team activities, As i was curious about how people can force their way into other computers, Often
Undected by the victim, And i learned alot, I used tools within linux enviroments such as, MetaSploit used for executing code against a remote target machine, JohnTheRipper One of the many password cracking tools i was able to use, Reconnaissance tools, Gobuster, Shodan.io,
I also used msfvenom to create load and create custom payloads, And exploited a vulnerability in SMB (Server Message Block Protocol) Used by windows, To recreate the EternalBlue Exploit.

- I had a lot of fun and leaned a ton of information from those red team rooms on tryhackme, But as somepoint i made a decision to focus on blue teaming in cybersecurity, On the TryHackMe website, You'll find some information on the different types of job oppurtunities wthin the field, And whether
or not those jobs would work for you based on the conditions, I quickly figured out that i wanted to work within an SOC (Security Operations Centere) As a security Analyst, Reading alerts and triaging events, To correlate true/false positives, And write reports on my findings.

So i began my journey to learning the skills of a SOC Analyst, TryHackMe Has learning road maps, You begin at Pre security, Where you'll learn some pre-requisite knowledge on attacking and defending in cybers security, This is followed by "Cyber Security 101" Where you learn about different
areas in computer security, Such as computer networking, Cryptography, Windows OS, Linux OS, Offensive and defensive Security tools, And the different cyber security careers, From there you'll branch off into 1 of 3 career paths these are, Security Analyst, Penetration Tester, Security Engineer.

Aspiring to become a Security Analyst i enrolled into the SOC Leve 1 Path, Where i learned a massive amount of extremely valuable information, I got hands on with almost every tool a blue (WORK IN PROGRESS)
