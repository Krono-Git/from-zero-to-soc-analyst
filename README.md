# My Cybersecurity Journey — From Beginner to SAL1 Certified

Hello! My name in jonathan and this is where I document my journey into cybersecurity. I'm currently focused on becoming a blue team specialist,
and this repo outlines my learning path, hands-on experience, and the steps I took to earn my first cybersecurity certification: **SAL1 (Security Analyst Level 1) by TryHackMe**

## Why Cybersecurity?

I’ve always had a strong interest in problem solving and technology. I've been using a computer for as long as i can remember, Of course in my early day's i wasn't creating firewall rules, Or performing malware analysis! I've come to learn about the field from various
YouTubers That i enjoy watching, I found myself deeply fascinated with the constant battle of blue vs red team in cybersecurity, And the investigations led by blue team efforts, Enjoying problem solving and technology myself, I decided to take a step in the field
And i haven't looked back since!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

I started with:
- learning the **basics** of cybersecurity, **Common threats and vulnerabilities**, Popular viruses and how they worked like the **WannaCry** Virus.
- The difference between each type of cyber attack and what caused them to work, The different types of hackers, And "Hat Colors" for them.
- I then moved onto **network fundamentals**, From various youtube courses and books, And learned about the **OSI model & TCP/IP Layers**.
- Soon after learning the fundamanetal basics i found the **TryHacKMe** Website, Where i focused a little bit more on **RedTeaming** at first, Getting an idea
of how Penetration Testers and Attackers operate, The tools they use, And the challeges they face.
- After Dabbling in red teaming, I began my **Blue Team pathway** on TryHackMe, With the end goal of grabbing the **SAL1 Certification**
- On 07/03/2025 I did pass my **SAL1 Certification**, Standing at **167 completed Rooms** and **24 earned badges** on **TryHackMe**.

## 📚 Learning Tools I Used

| **TryHackMe** | Core learning platform (SOC Level 1 path) |

| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Understanding real-world attacker behaviors |

| **Kibana / ELK Stack** | Log analysis and detection |

| **Autopsy** | Forensics and evidence analysis |

| **Windows Event Viewer / Sysmon** | Real-world log sources |

| **WireShark** | Packet Analysis | Examine DNS, DHCP, ARP, In real time! |

---

## 🧪 Labs, Rooms, and Writeups

I completed dozens of labs and SOC simulations. Some highlights:
- [x] **Servidae: Log Analysis in ELK**
- [x] **Compromised Windows Analysis**
- [x] **SOC Level 1: Final Simulation**
- [x] **BoogeyMan 1-3** - Splunk Investigation
- [ ] (More writeups coming soon)

## ✅ Earning the SAL1 Certification

- **First Attempt:** Failed (Ran Out Of Time For The SOC Simulator) — but I learned what I needed to work on: log analysis speed, report writing precision, and deeper MITRE usage.
- **Second Attempt:** Passed with a score of **768** In 4 hours.
- My main improvements:
  - Cut report writing time to under 5 minutes
  - Improved accuracy with Windows Event IDs and SIEM queries
  - Practiced explaining the **5Ws** in clear, structured reports

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Mastering the basics is more important than chasing advanced techniques.
- Writing clean, fast, and structured incident reports is **just as important** as detecting threats.
- Understanding normal system behavior helps you spot anomalies faster.
